# Air-Quality-Index-Analysis

Air quality index (AQI) analysis involves monitoring and analyzing air quality in a specific location. It aims to provide a numerical value representative of overall air quality, essential for public health and environmental management.

# Aim of the analysis:

1. Calculate and analyze the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on pollutant concentrations.
2. Examine the distribution of AQI categories to understand the prevalence of different air quality conditions.
3. Investigate hourly trends in AQI to identify patterns and peak pollution hours.
4. Explore correlations between different pollutants to assess their relationships.
5. Compare the calculated AQI metrics with recommended air quality metrics to evaluate the severity of air quality in Delhi.

# Dataset Description:

The dataset includes the following variables:

1. date: Date and time of the measurement.
2. co: Concentration of Carbon Monoxide (CO) in µg/m³.
3. no: Concentration of Nitric Oxide (NO) in µg/m³.
4. no2: Concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in µg/m³.
5. o3: Concentration of Ozone (O3) in µg/m³.
6. so2: Concentration of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) in µg/m³.
7. pm2_5: Concentration of Particulate Matter (PM2.5) in µg/m³.
8. pm10: Concentration of Particulate Matter (PM10) in µg/m³.
9. nh3: Concentration of Ammonia (NH3) in µg/m³.

# Result:
Analyzed the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Delhi in January 2023 by calculating AQI values based on pollutant concentrations.
